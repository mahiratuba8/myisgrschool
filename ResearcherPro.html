                        When writing and stating something that has been said or taken from another website, don’t
                        forget to
                        state the name of the source or the authors last name. Then make sure to elaborate further on
                        that statement you used from a different source and write about how it connects to what you were
                        writing assignment is about. Kind of like the SEE structure evidence and explain are very
                        differen, and you dont want your explaination to be from somewhere else.
                        Quotation is similar to citing, it makes it clear what you were stating is not your word but
                        rather from
                        another source, but don't forget to state from where those exact words you have quoted are
                        coming.

                    <p>
                        Paraphrasing is something we do a lot when researching, but it's important to understand that it
                        just
                        doesn’t mean switching up the words, but writing the information into your own words also it
                        requires
                        for ou to understand and explain it in a new way without changing the meaning.
