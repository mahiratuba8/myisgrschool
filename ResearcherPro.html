                            Firstly, you must choose a topic and ensure it aligns with the guidelines or expectations
                            your teacher has provided for you.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Narrow it down to a specific subtopic that you can focus on and expand upon in your writing
                            assignment.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Conduct an overview search to gain a good understanding of what you will be getting into,
                            and check with your teacher to verify if the topic is appropriate.

                        It is best to gather as much information as you can. But of course, it should be relevant to
                        what you need to find out.
                        Categorising notes when researching through colour, subtopics, and tags. Section out your
                        information. The best way to have a boring website is to section your information through your
                        sites (show a picture).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Don't use your sources as a division or organiser; evaluate the information you have collected
                        and plot it in the subtopics of your research report, poster, presentation, or assignment. It
                        will be easier to find information together when making the final product.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sort notes with titles and subtitles.
                        Bullet points for summary; you are not writing the text yet, meaning keeping your notes concise.

                        Make sure the information in the source is relevant and up to date and that it is still
                        reliable
                        in today's time. Using outdated information that is not going to be used can lead to
                        inaccurate
                        information and lead to limitations in your work.
                        Unbiased: Try looking for sources that have a balanced view on the topic,and present various
                        views on the topic.

                        Look for sources that have been written by experts in their field. Experts usually tend to
                        have

                        and you can figure that out by going to the About page where they would usually have most of
                        the
                        information about the members of that blog or website.

                            Some key aspects to look out for is if the information presented in the source is
                            demonstrable and
                            repeatable or based on objective facts and evidence. For example claims should be backed up
                            by
                            evidence, the methodology should be told in detail and statements supported.
                            It is also important that the information is presented accurately and that the source
                            contains
                            citations.
                            It is a real warning sign if a source is based on guesses, opinions, unproven figures,
                            inaccurate
                            presentations or citations.

                            Never stop at the surface level when checking the reliability of a source! Just because it
                            looks
                            good doesn't mean that it is reliable.

                            Every source contains a perspective, so before using a source, check how objective it seems.

                            A way to discover bias is to check how opinion-based a source is, that is if any personal
                            viewpoints
                            shine through.
                            It is a good sign if the source is based on objective research and contains empirical
                            evidence.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To discover bias it can be helpful to check what organization or institution is behind the
                            source.
                            If you read about it, it might say what objectives it has, if it is to engage, persuade,
                            inform etc.. It
                            is also good to check if any funding has been involved and more. If there is any own
                            interests and
                            funding behind it, it is a warning sign.

                            It can be good to look out for if a bias has been intentionally hidden, if the true purpose
                            of the
                            source (political, religious, commercial, social or other) has been masked.
                            This can have been done to make information appear more widespread and organic (picked up
                            from grassroot
                            level) in origin than it is, hiding the sponsor of the source or organization or withholding
                            other
                            important information to decide the bias of a source. This whole phenomenon is called

                            Factual information is useful to back up, for example an argument. It is objective, that is
                            not biased,
                            and reflects a research finding or multiple perspectives.
                            Opinionated information can be used to persuade, distort, or reflect somebody’s thinking. It
                            lacks
                            evidence to back it up though, because it is based on subjective information. It represents
                            someone’s or
                            an organization’s or institution’s perspective or interpretation.

                            research themselves, or whether they analyzed research done by others.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In primary sources, the person writing the piece did the research, witnessed the event, or
                            created
                            something new. Primary sources therefore require you to examine and interpret original
                            materials
                            directly. A helpful way to apply source evaluation can therefore be to examine the
                            historical and
                            cultural context, check how the purpose and audience have been considered, evaluate
                            potential biases and
                            limitations and draw independent conclusions.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In secondary sources, somebody evaluate or analyze what others have done, witnessed or
                            created.
                            Secondary sources therefore require you to evaluate how other scholars have interpreted
                            these materials
                            and the methods they used to reach their conclusions. A helpful way to do source evaluation
                            can be to
                            analyze scholarly interpretations, assess the source’s methodological frameworks, evaluate
                            theoretical
                            contributions and compare multiple perspectives.

                            At first you need to apply a general source evaluation test, like The 5 w’s: Who has written
                            what for
                            whom, when and why? In addition to that, you also need to check more things, since social
                            media is not
                            counted as a reliable source.

                        <ul>For example you need to consider:</ul>
                        <li>
                            How old is the account?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            What does the author's network look like? Do some background research of fans and followers:
                            Who is in
                            this network and who is following them? Who leaves comments?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            How reliable is the author? What social media channels and / or web pages is the author
                            running? What
                            kind of content shows up on these pages?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            What does the context look like? Does the author usually post about the topic? If so, what
                            do past or
                            updated posts say? Are details filled in as they occur?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            How reliable is the content? Can the information be verified via other sources?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            How geographically relevant is the source? If it features “breaking news” content, is the
                            author near
                            the location of the event?

                        <p>
                            The best way to avoid unreliable sources is to use scientific literature, such as found in
                            encyclopedias, databases, nonfiction books and more.
                            It also helps a lot to have a thorough understanding of what bias is, and keep in mind how
                            bias affects
                            your sources - and them in their turn - the quality of your school work.
                            You also need to consider not only the bias of other people, but also your own, in the
                            planning phase,
                            research phase, data collection, analysis and presentation of your school work.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you understand what bias means, it will be much easier to think critically and
                            independently, for
                            example when examining your sources.

                    When analysing students have a hard time to differentiate between / know how to properly conduct the
                    different activities syntesising, analysing, summarizing and evaluating sources. For example, you
                    usually synthesize information after you have summarized and analyzed multiple sources, when you
                    combine
                    information from each source to create a cohesive idea.

                </p>
                <p>
                    When you analyze information you examine elements and structure of a source, so you can more easily
                    interpretat or discuss it. When you evaluate information you draw conclusions, for example about its
                    reliability.

                    In research in general, it can be hard for students to select relevant sources, according to the
                    purpose
                    of their school work, decide the length of a cited excerpt and both do in-text citations and
                    citations
                    properly to avoid plagiarism. A common mistake is also to forget to mention illustrators and
                    translators
                    in the works cited list. As a librarian I think that it is very important that the students know how
                    and
                    why they should use in-text citations and citations.
